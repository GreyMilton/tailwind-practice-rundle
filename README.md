A personal test at doing Tailwind CSS styling in a short amount of time.

## Premise
I just went to https://www.rundlemall.com/ a moment ago and took screenshots of the homepage at one screen width.
I took the screenshots on a macbook pro with screen resolution 1280 x 800. The browser took up the full width of the screen.

I will attempt to redo the page at the one screen width (1280px), whilst only using the screenshots I have.

## Current status
I'm fairly happy with what I have acheived in such a short space of time.
I have done basic styling for the Header and all page content, with only the Footer left to go.

My next steps in this that I have in mind are:
- Do similar basic styling for the Footer.
- Make it the page responsive in a simple way.
- Import icons, svgs, and images.
- Determine the font(s) used and import them or similar.
- Fine tune the subtleties including hover and focus states, exact padding amounts, etc.
