# tailwind-practice-rundle
A personal test at doing Tailwind CSS styling in a short amount of time.

## Premise
I just went to https://www.rundlemall.com/ a moment ago and took screenshots of the homepage at one screen width.
I took the screenshots on a macbook pro with screen resolution 1280 x 800. The browser took up the full width of the screen.
I decided against placing the screenshots in here.

I will attempt to redo the page here, at the one screen width, whilst only using the screenshots I have.

## Time up for the session
Time has run out, but I'm fairly happy with what I acheived in such a short space of time.
I have done basic styling for the Header and the start of the Main page content.
My next steps in this that I have in mind are:
- Continue similar basic styling for the rest of the page.
- Make it basically responsive.
- Import icons, svgs, and images.
- Determine the font(s) used and import them or similar.
- Fine tune the subtleties including hover and focus states, exact padding amounts, etc.
