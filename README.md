# tailwind-practice-rundle
A personal test at doing Tailwind CSS styling in a short amount of time.

## Premise
I just went to https://www.rundlemall.com/ a moment ago and took screenshots of the homepage at one screen width.
I took the screenshots on a macbook pro with screen resolution 1280 x 800. The browser took up the full width of the screen.
I decided against placing the screenshots in here.

I will attempt to redo the page here, at the one screen width, whilst only the screenshots I have.
